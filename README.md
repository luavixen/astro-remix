# Astro! Remix
Astro! Remix is a Forge 1.20.1 rewrite of the original [Astro! Fabric mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/astro!) by Prismatica.

Astro is a small mod that introduces Mauveine, a new material crafted from netherite scrap and amethyst clusters.
Mauveine has a unique effect on local gravity, and it can be harnessed to make armor that's lighter than air, swords that can be effortlessly swung, and even the ability to completely override gravity in a small area.

This mod works well when used in combination with other mods, especially other movement-based items when you're floating around.

## Items

### Mauveine Ingot
![](https://dl.vixen.link/pswkhm/crafting_ingot.png)

The Mauveine Ingot is the base material used to craft all Mauveine armor, tools, and other gravity-manipulating items.
Crafted by combining netherite scrap and amethyst clusters in your crafting table.

### Mauevine Armor

Mauveine armor is lighter than air, and wearing a full set will allow you to float gently through the air when you jump.
The more pieces you wear, the lighter you become, and the slower you fall.
Craft the Mauveine Diadem, Mauveine Shoulder Pads, Mauveine Leggings, and Mauveine boots to make a full set!

Additionally, since Mauveine armor directly affects and controls your local gravity, wearing it will negate weaker external gravity manipulation, like gravity bombs.

### Mauveine Sabre

The Mauveine Sabre is a lightweight sword that can be swung effortlessly, allowing you to attack much faster compared to a regular sword.

### Gravity Bombs

Gravity Bombs are throwable items that can be used to manipulate gravity in a small area, kind of like a lingering potion.
Craft a Gravity Bomb (Up) to increase gravity in an area, or a Gravity Bomb (Down) to decrease gravity in an area.

When they explode, they shower the surrounding space with tiny shards and particles that, for a short while, will affect the gravity of any entity that comes into contact with them.
